// An isomorphism (up to primitive boxing and label names) between user-defined
// data types and a Shape.
//
// Intentionally restricted to Shapes to avoid the rabbit hole of being a
// typeclass capturing the concept of an isomorphism. As such, there are no laws
// pertaining to associativity because, by convention, a Shape should not appear
// in the A position and a B should always be a Shape. The former cannot be
// enforced in the type system and the latter is not enforced since it is too
// much for Scala 2.12 and below (specifically, the macros fail to produce the
// required evidence).
//
// Laws:
//
// - identity: to(from(b)) == b AND from(to(a)) == a
